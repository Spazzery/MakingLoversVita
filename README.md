# MakingLoversVita

Tools that I used to create a partial English patch for Making * Lovers VN on the PS Vita.

## build_new_info_bin.py
Probably the most valueable script here, as the info.bin file in the scripts archive contains all the choice offsets in the game (and nothing else). This script builds a new info.bin based on your scripts in the repack folder.

## extract_english_text_making_lovers.py
Potentially useful if you want to extract the text from the PC version.

## insert_English_into_Japanese_script.py
A bunch of code that is probably hard to read and quite crap, since I made this when I first started making text mixing scripts and didn't really know how to make them. I used it to mix the English text into the Japanese Vita scripts.
